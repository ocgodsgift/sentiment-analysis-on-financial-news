### Project Title: Sentiment Analysis for Financial News

### Introduction & Objective
What is Sentiment Analysis?

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the sentiment of text. It categorizes text into positive, neutral, or negative sentiment.

Why is Sentiment Analysis Important in Financial News?

Financial news can significantly impact stock prices, investor sentiment, and trading decisions. By analyzing the sentiment of financial news, investors can make informed decisions and predict market trends.

Project Objective:

The goal of this project is to build a sentiment analysis model that classifies financial news articles into positive, neutral, or negative sentiment using traditional machine learning models and a specialized deep learning model called FinBERT.

### Dataset Overview
Dataset Source:

We use the Financial PhraseBank dataset, compiled by Malo et al., which contains financial news sentences labeled with sentiment.

Dataset Features:
The dataset consists of two main columns:
- Sentiment: This column contains the sentiment labels (Positive, Neutral, Negative).
- News Sentence: This column contains financial news statements.
  
Data Summary:
- Total number of records: 4846
- Missing values in dataset: 0

### Data Preprocessing
Why is Data Preprocessing Important?

Raw text data is often messy, containing irrelevant characters, stopwords, and inconsistencies. Preprocessing helps clean the data for better model performance.

Steps Taken to Clean the Data:
- Removing Duplicates: Ensured that no repeated news sentences existed in the dataset.
- Handling Missing Values: Checked for missing entries and removed or imputed them where necessary.
- Tokenization & Stopword Removal: Used NLTK to break text into words and remove common words that do not contribute to sentiment analysis.
- Text Vectorization: Converted text into numerical format using CountVectorizer, which helps models understand word frequencies.

Which Machine Learning Models Were Used?

We implemented and compared two popular machine learning models:
- Logistic Regression: A simple yet powerful classification model that predicts probabilities for sentiment classes.
- Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble learning method that creates multiple decision trees to improve accuracy.

How Did We Train the Models?
- Split the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing.
- Used CountVectorizer to convert text into numerical features.
- Trained both models on the transformed dataset.

Evaluation Metrics:
- Accuracy Score: Measures how well the model correctly predicts sentiment.
- Confusion Matrix: Provides insights into model misclassifications.
- Classification Report: Shows precision, recall, and F1-score for each sentiment class.

- ### FinBERT Deep Dive
What is FinBERT?

FinBERT is a deep learning model specifically designed for financial text analysis. It is built on BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and fine-tuned on financial news data to improve sentiment classification.

Why Use FinBERT?
- Unlike traditional machine learning models, FinBERT understands the context of financial language better.
- It is pre-trained on large financial datasets, making it highly accurate for sentiment analysis in this domain.

Implementation Steps:
- Loaded FinBERT from the Hugging Face model repository.
- Tokenized financial news data to convert text into a format that FinBERT understands.
- Passed tokenized sentences through FinBERT to obtain sentiment predictions with confidence scores.

Results & Performance:
- FinBERT outperformed traditional models in accuracy and better captured financial context.
- Visualized results using classification reports and confusion matrices.

### Future Predictions & Enhancements
What Can We Improve in the Future?
- Expand the Dataset: Incorporate more financial news sources to enhance model accuracy.
- Fine-Tune FinBERT: Retrain the model on domain-specific financial datasets for even better predictions.
- Implement Real-Time Predictions: Deploy the model in a web application to analyze real-time financial news sentiment.

Potential Applications:
- Trading Strategies: Investors can use sentiment analysis to identify bullish or bearish trends.
- Market Analysis Tools: Businesses can integrate sentiment analysis to gauge public opinion on stocks and companies.
- News Monitoring Systems: Automate tracking of financial news sentiment and provide insights to analysts.

### Conclusion
- We successfully built a sentiment analysis model for financial news using traditional machine learning techniques and FinBERT.
- FinBERT provided better performance due to its financial text specialization.
- Future work includes fine-tuning and deploying the model for real-world applications.
